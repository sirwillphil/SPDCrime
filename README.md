Overview: The goal of the SPD Crime Map was to show the distribution of crime across all of the Seattle neighborhoods. I used a cloropleth map to show crime hotspots throughout the city. To get a better idea of the types of crimes happening, I added the ability to click on a neighborhood to see the individual crime locations. The graph on the left side shows the distribution of the types of crimes and is dynamic based on the selected neighborhood. I used crime data from the city of Seattle along with neighborhood boundries also from the city of Seattle. I used a juniper notebook to join both datasets together in order to get the counts of crimes in each neighborhood.
